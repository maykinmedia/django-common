Command line companion to the ``maykin-common`` Django utilities.

The command line script is deliberately written in pure Python without loading Django
at all (for performance), as opposed to providing Django management commands. Large
Django projects may see slow startup times in the order of 2-10s due to (expensive)
imports when loading all the code. This pairs very badly with health checks machinery
which tend to have timeouts of a couple of seconds.

    Run health checks for the Celery worker.

    The worker health checks consist of separate components. The defaults are geared
    towards liveness checks, but you can disable/enable parts to adapt to your
    situation.

    * Check the `liveness-file` to detect issues in the worker event loop. If the event
      loop is broken, the worker will definitely not be processing tasks and a restart
      is necessary.
    * Ping the worker using Celery's inspection machinery. Pinging verifies the broker
      connection, as it performs a complete roundtrip. Broker connection loss can
      sometimes be solved by restarting the worker.
    * Check the presence of the `readiness-file`. Absence of the readiness file
      indicates the worker is not (yet) ready to process tasks. It may have been stopped
      or is still starting up.

    If any check fails, the command exist with a non-zero exit code.
