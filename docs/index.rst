Re-usable utilities for Maykin Django projects.

Maykin's Django projects all share a common base: `default-project`_ to provide a
consistent and recognizable structure accross projects. This library bundles some shared
utilities that are common in (most) projects but are too small/specific to warrant a
separate library.

maykin-common acts as a vehicle to quickly propagate changes and useful helpers to a
large number of projects that would otherwise all have to be updated manually and
one-by-one, a labour-intensive task.

**What's up with the name?**

A similar utility for the client side exists: https://github.com/maykinmedia/client-common
so we wanted to mimick this naming pattern. The NPM package has namespacing:
``@maykinmedia/client-common``, but this doesn't exist on PyPI, while using
``django-common`` as a PyPI package name *might* just be a bit arrogant.

So, the repository ``maykinmedia/django-common`` perfectly covers the contents and
purpose of the package, while the PyPI package keeps the imports short and focused:
``maykin_common``, while leaving room for potential future non-Django packages.

Features
========

* Centralized maintenance of shared utilities, facilitating upgrades accross projects.
* Clear changelog and notice of potential breaking changes.
* Zero footprint (CPU and/or memory) for unused utilities.
* Optional dependency groups to minimize attack surface and external dependencies.
* Tailored to our typical Maykin setup with default-project.
